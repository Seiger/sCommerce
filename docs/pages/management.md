After installing the module, you can use it immediately. Path to the module in the 
administrator panel **Admin Panel -> Modules -> Commerce**.

You can also fix quick access to the module through the main menu of the Admin Panel. 
This can be done on the configuration tab (only available for the administrator role).

When moving to the middle of the store module, a list of tabs will be presented to 
your attention.

Each tab has its own functionality and access level. Let's consider each tab in more detail.

## Products

The Products tab displays a complete list of products and services provided by your store.
The list is presented in the form of an image of the product, its name, which in turn is a
hyperlink to product page to the frontend, as well as additional information and product
management buttons.

The page also includes a product search form and filters for a quick search for the required
item. For ease of management, you can sort products by all fields of the presentation table
as in both forward and reverse. The fields for the product presentation table are
customizable on the Settings tab.

If your store has more products than you chose to display on the page, other products
will automatically move to another page, and pagination will appear at the bottom.
Note that the choice of spherical of products on the backend product list page does
not affect the display of the number of frontend products.

## Settings

On the Settings tab, you manage all the settings of your store. Note that this tab
available only to users with the site administrator role.

In this tab, you can control how the store is displayed in the main menu of the admin panel
as well as other tabs displayed in the store module. And you also have an on/off option
additional functionality of the store.

You can also hide or show certain fields in a product or order, as well
rename certain fields so that the store manager has a clearer idea of which
functionality a particular field has.
