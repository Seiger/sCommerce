# Built-in Payment Methods

sCommerce includes two payment methods out of the box:

1. **Cash Payment** - Accept cash payments (cash on delivery)
2. **Bank Invoice Payment** - Accept bank transfers via invoice

## Cash Payment

### Overview

The Cash Payment method is a simple payment option that doesn't require integration with external payment gateways. It's ideal for:

- Cash on Delivery (COD) orders
- In-store pickups with cash payment
- Local deliveries with cash collection
- Markets where cash is the preferred payment method

### Features

- ✅ **No external dependencies** - Works without third-party integrations
- ✅ **Simple configuration** - Minimal setup required
- ✅ **Custom messaging** - Add informational text for customers
- ✅ **Multi-language support** - Localized titles and descriptions
- ✅ **No transaction fees** - Direct payment without intermediaries

### Configuration

#### Step 1: Access Payment Methods

1. Navigate to: **Admin Panel → Modules → Commerce → Payments**
2. Find "Cash" in the list of payment methods
3. Click on the payment method to configure it

#### Step 2: Basic Settings

**Active**: Toggle to enable/disable the payment method

**Position**: Set the display order (lower numbers appear first)

**Title**: Localized payment method name displayed to customers
- English: "Cash"
- Ukrainian: "Готівка"
- Russian: "Наличные"

**Description**: Localized description shown during checkout
- English: "Pay with cash upon delivery or pickup"
- Ukrainian: "Оплата готівкою при отриманні"
- Russian: "Оплата наличными при получении"

#### Step 3: Additional Settings

**Info Message**: Optional message displayed to customers during checkout

Example messages:
- "Please have exact change ready for delivery"
- "Cash payment accepted only in local currency"
- "Deliveries over $500 may require advance payment"

### Usage in Checkout

When a customer selects the Cash payment method during checkout:

1. The payment method title and description are displayed
2. The info message (if configured) is shown
3. The order is created with status "pending payment"
4. No payment button is shown (payment will be collected offline)

### Order Processing

When processing orders with cash payment:

1. **Order Created**: Status is set to "pending"
2. **Order Prepared**: Update status to "ready for shipment"
3. **Order Shipped**: Update status to "shipped"
4. **Payment Collected**: After cash is received, update status to "paid"
5. **Order Completed**: Mark order as "completed"

### Frontend Integration

#### Display Payment Method

The cash payment method is automatically included in the checkout payment methods list:

```php
$checkout = new sCheckout();
$paymentMethods = $checkout->getPayments();

foreach ($paymentMethods as $method) {
    echo '<div class="payment-method">';
    echo '<input type="radio" name="payment_method" value="' . $method['key'] . '">';
    echo '<label>' . $method['title'] . '</label>';
    echo '<p>' . $method['description'] . '</p>';
    echo '</div>';
}
```

#### Get Specific Payment Method

```php
$checkout = new sCheckout();
$cashPayment = $checkout->getPayment('cash');

// Access payment details
echo $cashPayment['title'];       // "Cash"
echo $cashPayment['description']; // "Pay with cash upon delivery"
echo $cashPayment['info'];        // Info message (if configured)
```

### API Integration

#### Get Available Payment Methods

```http
GET /api/checkout/payments
```

Response:
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "payments": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "key": "cash",
            "name": "cash",
            "title": "Cash",
            "description": "Pay with cash upon delivery or pickup",
            "info": "Please have exact change ready"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Process Cash Payment

```http
POST /api/checkout/pay/cash
```

Request body:
```json
{
    "order_id": 123,
    "payment_method": "cash"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Order created successfully",
    "order": {
        "id": 123,
        "status": "pending",
        "payment_method": "cash"
    }
}
```

### Best Practices

#### 1. **Clear Communication**
- Provide clear instructions about cash payment in the description
- Specify if exact change is required
- Mention any maximum cash payment limits

#### 2. **Order Verification**
- Call customers before shipping to confirm the order
- Verify the delivery address
- Confirm the payment amount

#### 3. **Delivery Instructions**
- Train delivery personnel on cash collection procedures
- Provide receipts for all cash transactions
- Use secure cash handling methods

#### 4. **Risk Management**
- Set maximum order value for cash payments
- Require prepayment for high-value orders
- Monitor for suspicious orders

### Customization

#### Custom Info Messages by Language

```php
// In admin panel, set different messages for each language:

// English
info: "Cash payment accepted. Please have exact change ready."

// Ukrainian
info: "Приймаємо оплату готівкою. Будь ласка, підготуйте точну суму."

// Russian
info: "Принимаем оплату наличными. Пожалуйста, подготовьте точную сумму."
```

#### Display Custom Message in Template

```blade
@php
    $checkout = new \Seiger\sCommerce\Checkout\sCheckout();
    $cashPayment = $checkout->getPayment('cash');
@endphp

@if(isset($cashPayment['info']) && $cashPayment['info'])
    <div class="alert alert-info">
        <i class="icon-info"></i>
        {{ $cashPayment['info'] }}
    </div>
@endif
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Payment Method Not Showing

1. **Check if active**: Ensure the payment method is enabled in admin panel
2. **Check position**: Verify the position number is set correctly
3. **Check permissions**: Ensure payment methods are enabled globally
4. **Clear cache**: Clear system cache to refresh payment methods

#### Payment Not Processing

1. **Validate order data**: Ensure order ID and payment method are provided
2. **Check order status**: Verify order can accept payments
3. **Review logs**: Check system logs for payment processing errors

### Example Template

Complete checkout payment selection:

```blade
<div class="payment-methods">
    <h3>Choose Payment Method</h3>
    
    @php
        $checkout = new \Seiger\sCommerce\Checkout\sCheckout();
        $payments = $checkout->getPayments();
    @endphp
    
    @foreach($payments as $payment)
        <div class="payment-method-option">
            <label class="payment-method-label">
                <input 
                    type="radio" 
                    name="payment_method" 
                    value="{{ $payment['key'] }}"
                    required
                >
                <span class="payment-title">{{ $payment['title'] }}</span>
            </label>
            
            @if(!empty($payment['description']))
                <p class="payment-description">{{ $payment['description'] }}</p>
            @endif
            
            @if(!empty($payment['info']))
                <div class="payment-info">
                    <i class="icon-info"></i>
                    {{ $payment['info'] }}
                </div>
            @endif
        </div>
    @endforeach
</div>
```

        <td>Payment for order #{{ $order->id }}</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p><strong>Payment Deadline:</strong> {{ $deadline }}</p>
```

### Admin Functions

#### Verify Payment

```php
use Seiger\sCommerce\Models\sOrder;

// Find order
$order = sOrder::find($orderId);

// Verify payment received
if ($paymentReceived) {
    $order->update([
        'status' => 'paid',
        'paid_at' => now(),
        'payment_note' => 'Bank transfer verified on ' . now()->format('Y-m-d H:i'),
    ]);
    
    // Send confirmation email
    Mail::to($order->customer_email)->send(new PaymentConfirmed($order));
}
```

#### Generate Invoice

```php
use Seiger\sCommerce\Models\sOrder;
use App\Services\InvoiceGenerator;

$order = sOrder::find($orderId);
$invoice = InvoiceGenerator::generate($order);

// Save invoice
$order->invoice_path = $invoice->save();
$order->save();

// Send to customer
Mail::to($order->customer_email)
    ->send(new InvoiceGenerated($order, $invoice));
```

### Statistics and Reporting

Track bank invoice payments:

```php
use Seiger\sCommerce\Models\sOrder;

// Get all bank invoice orders
$bankInvoiceOrders = sOrder::where('payment_method', 'bank_invoice')
    ->where('status', 'paid')
    ->get();

// Calculate total received
$totalReceived = sOrder::where('payment_method', 'bank_invoice')
    ->where('status', 'paid')
    ->sum('total');

// Get awaiting payment
$awaitingPayment = sOrder::where('payment_method', 'bank_invoice')
    ->where('status', 'awaiting_payment')
    ->get();

// Get overdue payments
$overduePayments = sOrder::where('payment_method', 'bank_invoice')
    ->where('status', 'awaiting_payment')
    ->where('created_at', '<', now()->subDays(7))
    ->get();
```

### Customizing Payment Display

The Bank Invoice payment method uses a Blade template that can be customized to match your site's design.

#### Template Resolution

The system looks for templates in this order:
1. **Custom template**: `assets/modules/scommerce/payment/bank_invoice.blade.php`
2. **Default template**: `core/vendor/seiger/scommerce/payment/bank_invoice.blade.php`

#### Customization

To customize the payment display, create a copy of the default template:

```bash
# Copy the default template to customize it
cp core/vendor/seiger/scommerce/payment/bank_invoice.blade.php assets/modules/scommerce/payment/bank_invoice.blade.php
```

#### Available Variables

You can use the following variables in your Blade template (see Blade comments in the template file for full documentation):

- `$title` - Payment method title (localized)
- `$account_holder` - Company or individual name
- `$bank_name` - Full name of the bank
- `$account_number` - IBAN account number
- `$bank_code` - Bank code (MFO/SWIFT)
- `$tax_id` - Tax ID / EDRPOU / IPN
- `$amount` - Payment amount
- `$currency` - Currency code
- `$order_id` - Order ID/number
- `$payment_terms` - Number of days for payment
- `$info` - Additional instructions (text)

#### Example Customization

```blade
{{-- Custom template example --}}
<div class="my-custom-invoice">
    <h2>{{ $title }}</h2>
    
    <div class="amount-display">
        Amount to pay: <strong>{{ $amount }} {{ $currency }}</strong>
    </div>
    
    <div class="bank-info">
        <p>Bank: {{ $bank_name }}</p>
        <p>Account: {{ $account_number }}</p>
        <p>Purpose: Payment for order #{{ $order_id }}</p>
    </div>
    
    @if($info)
        <div class="instructions">
            {!! nl2br(e($info)) !!}
        </div>
    @endif
</div>

<style>
.my-custom-invoice {
    /* Your custom styles */
}
</style>
```

#### Benefits of Blade Templates

- **Security**: Automatic escaping of variables
- **Flexibility**: Full Blade directive support (@if, @foreach, etc.)
- **Clean Syntax**: Easy to read and maintain
- **No Comments in Output**: Blade comments won't appear in HTML source

#### Fallback Template

If the template file doesn't exist or fails to render, the system will use a built-in default template. This ensures the payment method works even if the template file is missing.

### Troubleshooting

#### Payment Not Showing

1. **Check bank details**: Ensure all required fields are filled
2. **Verify active status**: Payment method must be enabled
3. **Check permissions**: Ensure payment methods are globally enabled
4. **Check template**: Verify template file exists at `assets/modules/scommerce/payment/bank_invoice.blade.php`

#### Template Not Loading

1. **Check file path**: Ensure template is in correct location
2. **Check file permissions**: File must be readable by web server
3. **Check Blade syntax**: Ensure Blade syntax is valid
4. **Clear cache**: Clear Blade cache and system cache
5. **Check logs**: Review error logs for template rendering errors

#### Customers Not Receiving Details

1. **Check email templates**: Verify email template includes bank details
2. **Test email sending**: Send test emails to verify delivery
3. **Check spam folders**: Emails may be filtered as spam

#### Payment Confirmation Issues

1. **Match amounts exactly**: Including decimal places
2. **Verify order numbers**: Check payment purposes
3. **Check transaction dates**: Ensure within payment terms
